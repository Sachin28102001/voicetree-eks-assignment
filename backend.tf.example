# Backend Configuration for Production
# 
# This example shows how to configure remote state storage with S3.
# For this assignment, we're using local state for simplicity.
# 
# To use S3 backend:
# 1. Create S3 bucket: aws s3 mb s3://your-terraform-state-bucket
# 2. Create DynamoDB table for locking
# 3. Copy this file to backend.tf and update values
# 4. Run: terraform init -migrate-state

terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "voicetree-terraform-state"
    key            = "eks/dev/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "ap-south-1"
    encrypt        = true
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-state-lock"
  }
}
